slacker-news3-
==============

Slackers News project revisted with postgreSQL rather than CSV files. 

First two versions of slacker news can be found here:

first version: https://github.com/dpoint01/Slacker-News--First-Run-

second version: https://github.com/dpoint01/Slacker-News-Web-App-Final

These three versions are not incremental in quality, the same example was just re-used for practice with web apps
(simple practice with get and post methods, than reading info from a json, than stroing info using SQl queries, etc...)
